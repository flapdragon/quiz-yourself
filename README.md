# Quiz Yourself

Simple quiz builder written in Svelte. You supply the questions and answers and the app does the rest.

## Getting Started

Git clone the project. Then cd into the project directory and ...

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# start the development server
npm run dev
```

## TODO

1. Add data persistence for both questions and statistics
2. Add statistics: times viewed, times answered, % of right/wrong answers
3. Add search/filtering for questions based on statistics
